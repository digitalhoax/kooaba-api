# kooaba Data API
Data API Version 1.1 (2010-12-20)


## Introduction
The kooaba data API provides the ability to manage content in kooaba's image recognition system.
It is implemented as a [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) web service using XML data over HTTP and allows to add and remove
images, as well as their associated meta data. Images that have been uploaded via the Data API are then available for recognition via the Query API.

## Data Model

The recognition system is organized into groups, items, images and item-resources. API users are member
of one or more groups, which they can add data to. 

Each item can have one or more reference images associated with it. Each of these images can "trigger" the recognition of the item, when a query image matches the respective database image.

Each item can also have meta-data associated with it. We call this meta-data item-resources. (Not to be confused with the resources in the REST terminology.)

## Basic Workflow

The workflow follows the data structure (and is reflected accordingly in the REST URLs).

Before adding any data to the system, you need write permission for a _group_. If you don't have write access to any group yet, please contact kooaba sales to get access.

When adding data to the system, you start with an _item_. An item represents the physical object you 
want to make recognizable. It is a container for images which identify the object. Besides the images, the item contains also associated meta-data, among other things the mandatory title. A particularly important meta-data field for an item is the reference-id. This is an id you can set, and which is later returned when making requests. Typically you would use this to associate the items in our system with your internal id scheme.

After an item has been created, you can add associated _images_. To that end, you first upload a binary file to our service, and then associate it with an image resource.

## Authentication

All requests to the kooaba API's have to be authenticated. Authentication is managed using our custom KWS HTTP authentication scheme. 

Authentication is [described on the Query API Documentation](../query_api/README.md).

## Making Requests

There are two basic types of requests, read requests and write requests. Read requests are HTTP GET
requests which return XML-encoded data representations of the requested resources. Write requests
allow to create new resources (POST), update existing resources (PUT) or delete resources (DELETE).

### Access Control

When trying to access resources which do not belong to the user, an empty response with status code
`403 Forbidden` is returned.

When trying to perform write operations on read-only resources, an empty response with status code
`405 Method Not Allowed` is returned.

### Uploads

Some operations, like creating images, allow or require you to attach a file to the record. To do this via the API, you need to send a POST request to the "/api/uploads.xml" URI. The body of the request should be the content of the file you want to attach:

**Request**

    POST /api/uploads.xml

    Content-Type: image/jpeg
    
    [BINARY DATA]

If the upload succeeds, you'll get an XML response back, telling you the ID of your upload. (Your upload is not yet associated with any record, and if you do not do anything with it, it will be deleted within the next hour.)

**Response**

    Status: 200 OK

    <upload>
      <id>94cc5d8.2</id>
    </upload>
